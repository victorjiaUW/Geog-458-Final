            description: 'Seattle is known for its abundance of green spaces, lush parks, and sustainable urban planning, making it one of the greenest cities in the U.S. However, despite these efforts, the city faces ongoing challenges in managing water runoff, especially during heavy rainfall, which can lead to flooding and pollution. Additionally, illegal dumping remains a significant issue, with waste often finding its way into local waterways, impacting water quality and wildlife. Addressing these issues requires both better infrastructure and stronger community engagement in environmental stewardship.',

This approach helps reduce pollution by preventing untreated runoff from directly entering ecosystems, thus protecting biodiversity. GSI also enhances urban resilience by slowing down water flow, reducing flooding, and improving water quality in local waterways.',

Additionally, retrofitting existing urban spaces with these systems can help manage excess water during heavy rainfall, reducing pollution and preventing flooding. Investing in these sustainable solutions not only improves water quality but also enhances the resilience of urban environments to climate change.',
